  <p>With all of the dating sites geared towards specific interests or lifestyles why hasn't this been thought of sooner? Wanting to give pet lovers a place they can connect with others I created PuppyLove. A dating app geared towards individuals with a deep passion for all things animals!</p>
  
## PERN Stack
<p>PuppyLove was built using the PERN stack as the foundation of the application. The application includes JWT authentication for login and access, a messaging feature using Twilio's Chat API (limited functionality), and image uploads are handled using Cloudinary's API. Designed with a mobile first approach the application includes a Carousel feature to browse users as well as responsive navigation and layouts.</p>

## Features

### Login Authentication
<p>Using JWT, bcrypt, & form data users are able to create profiles, log in & out, and are granted limited access within the applicaiton before being authenticated.</p>

## Additional Information
<p>This application was designed and developed as part of a full-stack project that required developing an application using the PERN stack. As my first full-stack project I expanded upon those requirements by including additional features and functionality within the application such as login authentication & use of 3rd party API's (Twilio & Cloudinary). Also worth nothing is that while working with Twilio's Chat API I did run into issues that limited my ability to incorporate a fully functioning chat feature within the application. While is does allow user's connected into the same chat room to real-time communicate and send messages to other users there is limited functionality as of this writing related to receiving messages and retrieving conversations.</p>
